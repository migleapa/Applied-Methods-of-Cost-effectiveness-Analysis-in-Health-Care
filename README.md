I have developed a decision tree model to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of new treatment for Malaria in Kenya. I have estimated the costs from health providers perspective and expressed benefits as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Some of the parameters were obtained from Shillcutt, S. et al. (2008) study and some of them were hypothetical. I performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of uncertainty in the modelâ€™s parameter values on the cost-effectiveness results. I used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate uncertainty and presented this using cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC).
